# Javascript-Project
I practice javascript coding, and I made some games with javascript!

Please note that all original code of games belong to https://github.com/Apress/foundation-game-design-w-html5-javascript/tree/master/Code%20-%20Published, I just made some variation. 

The facebook file is a small userprofile website I made, you can go to https://liurenyu.000webhostapp.com/index.html to try it.
